A second July 7-to-14 trip, beginning in Harrogate, includes sessions at the Equestrian Center, a tour of York, a visit to the Great Yorkshire Show, one of England's largest horse shows and fairs, and two days of riding over scenic countryside. Rides across 200 square miles of moorland in Devon are the feature of the July 14-to-22 trip; the July 28-to-Aug. 4 trip takes place in Scotland and includes lessons, a swim on horseback through a canal, and scenic drives along a route that extends from the vicinity of Inverness to Edinburgh.
